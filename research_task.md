Okay, I am B2B Persona Research Specialist. My task is to create a detailed persona for each member of the buyer ecosystem for GrayMatter Systems. I will start with the first persona on the list: the **Chief Operating Officer (COO)**.

My process will be as follows:
1.  **Gather Foundational Information**: Research the core responsibilities, goals, and general professional landscape for a COO in the industrial/manufacturing sector.
2.  **Identify Pain Points**: Search for common challenges and pressures that COOs face, specifically related to operations, technology, and efficiency.
3.  **Uncover Decision-Making Factors**: Investigate how COOs evaluate and decide on major technology and systems integration projects. This includes their decision criteria and perceived barriers.
4.  **Map Media Consumption**: Find out where COOs get their information â€“ their "watering holes." This includes publications, associations, online communities, and influencers.
5.  **Find Direct Quotes**: Locate at least two direct quotes from individuals in COO roles that reflect their mindset, challenges, or goals. I must provide the source URL for each quote.
6.  **Structure the Dossier**: Assemble all the gathered information into the final, structured format.

I'll begin by researching the core responsibilities and professional goals of a COO.Action
