    For each final persona:
    1. Merge similar roles or titles from the research into one unified profile.
    2. Preserve key factual details while improving clarity, tone, and completeness.
    3. Ensure each profile has all sections required for the reporting task's "Core Persona Information" and "Product/Persona Connection" categories.

       - **Decision**: How do they make their final selection? Include key questions.
