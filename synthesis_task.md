### **Buyer Journey Map: Strategic Sam**

*   **Awareness: The Tipping Point**
    *   **Description:** Sam is triggered into action by a significant business event. This isn't a minor inconvenience; it's a board-level problem. It could be a major safety incident, a failed regulatory audit, a competitor's announcement of a major efficiency gain, or financial reports showing consistently declining margins due to operational inefficiencies. The status quo is no longer acceptable because it now represents a clear and present danger to profitability or compliance.
    *   **Key Questions:**
        *   "Why are our operational costs consistently higher than the industry benchmark?"
        *   "How can we de-risk our operations to prevent another safety/compliance failure?"
        *   "Are we equipped to handle the supply chain and market volatility we're seeing?"
        *   "What strategic investments will give us a competitive advantage for the next 5-10 years?"

*   **Consideration: Evaluating Strategic Options**
    *   **Description:** Sam doesn't look at specific products; they look at strategic solutions. They delegate the initial technical research to their team (Engineering Eric, Technical Tom) but frames the objective. They engage with peers and consulting firms to understand different approaches (e.g., "Should we overhaul one plant as a pilot, or invest in an enterprise-wide data platform?"). They review high-level proposals and business cases, looking for the option that best aligns with long-term business goals.
    *   **Key Questions:**
        *   "What is the full scope of this transformation, and what are the resource implications?"
        *   "Which potential partner has the strategic vision, not just the technical skill, to guide us?"
        *   "What are the top 2-3 credible approaches to solving this core business problem?"
        *   "Show me a case study from a company of our size, in our industry, that proves this works."

*   **Decision: The Business Case Sign-Off**
    *   **Description:** The final decision rests on a bulletproof business case. Sam's team presents a final recommendation with a primary vendor and a backup. Sam scrutinizes the financial models, the risk mitigation plan, and the vendor's long-term partnership potential. They are the final gatekeeper for capital allocation, and their approval depends on their confidence that this investment will deliver the promised business outcomes and strengthen the company's future.
    *   **Key Questions:**
        *   "What is the total cost of ownership over the next five years?"
        *   "What are the contractual guarantees for performance and support?"
        *   "How does this vendor's proposal compare financially and strategically to the other finalists?"
        *   "Am I confident presenting this investment and its expected ROI to the board?"

### **Buyer Journey Map: Operations Olivia**

*   **Awareness: The Daily Fire**
    *   **Description:** Olivia's awareness isn't strategic; it's tactical and painful. The same machine breaks down for the third time this month. An operator makes a critical error because the HMI is confusing, leading to a scrapped batch. She spends her days putting out fires and knows it's unsustainable. She goes to her boss, Engineering Eric, not with a solution, but with a clear problem: "We are losing too much time and money on Line 3. We need to do something."
    *   **Key Questions:**
        *   "Why does this same problem keep happening?"
        *   "How can I make it easier for my operators to do their jobs right the first time?"
        *   "What is causing all this unplanned downtime, and how do I fix it for good?"
        *   "We can't keep hitting our numbers like this. What can we do?"

*   **Consideration: The Practicality Test**
    *   **Description:** Olivia is a key participant in the evaluation process, serving as the "reality check." While Eric and Tom look at architecture, she looks at usability. She wants to see a demo. She asks tough questions about how the system will handle real-world scenarios. She is the biggest advocate for her operators and maintenance staff, ensuring any proposed solution will make their lives easier, not harder.
    *   **Key Questions:**
        *   "Can I see a demo of how an operator would handle a typical alarm?"
        *   "How much training will my team need, and who provides it?"
        *   "What is your plan for the cutover? How much downtime are you projecting?"
        *   "Can we talk to another plant manager who is using this system today?"

*   **Decision: The Vote for Usability and Trust**
    *   **Description:** Olivia's vote carries immense weight. If she believes a solution is too complex or that the implementation will be too disruptive, she can effectively veto the project. Her final decision is based on her confidence that the chosen partner understands her operational reality and that the new system will be embraced, not resisted, by her team on the plant floor. She champions the solution that she believes will finally put out the daily fires.
    *   **Key Questions:**
        *   "Which solution will my team actually be able to use and support?"
        *   "Which partner gives me the most confidence that they will minimize disruption to my schedule?"
        *   "Is this system going to help us solve problems faster?"
        *   "Do I trust this vendor's team to be on my plant floor working alongside my people?"
